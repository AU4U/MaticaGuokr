1
00:00:02,051 --> 00:00:04,315
So, what you're eating
is not technically yogurt.

2
00:00:04,486 --> 00:00:06,750
It doesn't have enough
live acidophilus cultures.

3
00:00:06,922 --> 00:00:10,153
It's really just ice milk
with carrageenan added for thickness.

4
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:15,160
- Well, that's very interesting.
- It's also not pink and has no berries.

5
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:18,831
Yeah, but it doesn't really
answer my question.

6
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:21,629
- What was your question again?
- Do you want some?

7
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:23,294
Ah.

8
00:00:23,706 --> 00:00:25,901
- Right. No. I'm lactose intolerant.
- Right.

9
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:28,202
- So gas.
- Yeah, got it.

10
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:31,840
Well, good night.

11
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:49,562
- What are you doing?
- There was a draft.

12
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:51,497
PENNY:
I didn't feel a draft.

13
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:56,601
- Why don't we just go into your--?
- Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:56,772 --> 00:00:58,672
Maybe we should
slow things down a little.

15
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:01,366
No, I didn't mean
to go into your apartment to go fast.

16
00:01:01,543 --> 00:01:03,170
No, I know.

17
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,505
I know what you meant.
It's just this is only our first date.

18
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:07,740
Okay. Sure. No problem.

19
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:10,180
Why don't we just figure out
where we're going...

20
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:12,479
...and when we want to get there?

21
00:01:12,654 --> 00:01:16,522
And then rate of speed
equals distance over time.

22
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,360
Solve for R.

23
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:23,021
Or we could just wing it.

24
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:26,034
That might work too.

25
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:28,727
- Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

26
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:35,673
He's coming. Screen saver.

27
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:42,306
Oh, hey, Leonard.

28
00:01:42,484 --> 00:01:45,078
- How was your date?
- Bite me.

29
00:01:47,256 --> 00:01:50,783
Sheldon, how could you just sit there
and let them spy on me?

30
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,983
They were clever.

31
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:55,528
They exploited my complete lack of interest
in what you were doing.

32
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:59,834
You should thank us.
When future generations try to determine...

33
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:02,630
...why your relationship with Penny
crashed and burned...

34
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:05,740
...this right here is the black box.

35
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:08,706
What are you talking about?
The date went fine.

36
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:10,708
She said she wants to slow things down.

37
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,609
Okay, so she said
she wants to slow things down.

38
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:17,616
It's like saying,
"I'm really enjoying this meal.

39
00:02:17,786 --> 00:02:20,619
I'm going to slow down and savor it."

40
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:24,316
No, it's like, "This fish tastes bad...

41
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,995
...so I'm gonna slow down
and spit it out."

42
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:31,997
- You being the fish.
- I'm not the fish.

43
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:33,930
Oh, really?
Did you make a second date?

44
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:39,233
- Well, no. We sort of decided to wing it.
- Oh, even I know that's lame.

45
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:42,232
Okay. All right.
Let's assume your hypothesis.

46
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:45,938
We went to dinner, we talked,
we laughed, we kissed.

47
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:47,513
Where could I have gone wrong?

48
00:02:47,683 --> 00:02:50,846
Think back, Leonard.
The littlest things can set women off.

49
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:55,080
Like, "Hey, the waitress is hot. I bet
we could get her to come home with us."

50
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:59,985
Or, "How much does your mom weigh?
I wanna know what I'm getting into."

51
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:03,598
- I didn't say anything like that.
- Good, because they don't work.

52
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,234
They don't care for it
if you stare at them and hyperventilate.

53
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:09,768
Sadly, that's my home-run swing.

54
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:12,433
Look, everything went fine.

55
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:16,635
I didn't even have to refer
to my impromptu conversation starters.

56
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:19,144
That woman across the hall is into me.

57
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:21,339
Let's go to the tape.

58
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:25,445
Look at her reaction
to the good-night kiss.

59
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:29,990
No change in respiration, pupils undilated,
no flushing of the chest.

60
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:32,183
Nice close-up, by the way.

61
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:35,655
Interesting. Her jaws are clenched.
No tongue access.

62
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:39,164
Clearly a bad sign
amongst mating humans.

63
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:41,365
That's not a bad sign.

64
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:45,131
Please. You might as well have been
two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.

65
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:48,535
And the worst sign of all
is you're here and not there.

66
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,202
I'm not there,
because I'm taking things slow.

67
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:55,839
Which, by the way, compared to you guys,
approaches warp speed.

68
00:03:57,085 --> 00:04:00,077
And take down that camera.

69
00:04:01,623 --> 00:04:04,592
He was a lot more fun
when he had no hope.

70
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,196
Give him time.

71
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,091
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Penny.

72
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:48,134
Yeah, FYI, the hot water is inadequate
on Machine 2, so colors only.

73
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:51,363
Four is still releasing the fabric softener
too early in the cycle.

74
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,873
- So I'd avoid using that for your delicates.
- Thanks.

75
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:58,805
Well, good Lord.

76
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:02,747
Why don't you just take your clothes down
to the river and beat them with a rock?

77
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:10,083
Sheldon, may I ask you a question?

78
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:14,221
I would prefer that you not,
but I won't go so far as to forbid it.

79
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,061
All right, I heard "yes," so....

80
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:19,495
Okay, here's my question:

81
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:24,668
Has Leonard ever dated,
you know, a regular girl?

82
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:29,242
Well, I assume you're not referring
to digestive regularity.

83
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,778
Because I've come to learn
that such inquiries are inappropriate.

84
00:05:34,516 --> 00:05:39,476
No, I meant has he ever been involved
with someone who wasn't a brainiac?

85
00:05:39,654 --> 00:05:41,849
Oh! Well, a few years ago...

86
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:46,085
...he did go out with a woman
who had a Ph.D. in French literature.

87
00:05:46,895 --> 00:05:51,594
- How is that not a brainiac?
- Well, for one thing, she was French.

88
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:56,196
For another, it was literature.

89
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:03,644
So....

90
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:07,210
Do you think that if Leonard
and I keep dating...

91
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:09,816
...he'll eventually get bored with me?

92
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,782
- That depends.
- On what?

93
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:20,861
Do you have a working knowledge
of quantum physics?

94
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:22,291
No.

95
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:24,455
Do you speak Klingon?

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,024
No.

97
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:28,926
- You know any card tricks?
- Okay.

98
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:35,299
I get it. Leonard has no business
being involved with a waitress/actress...

99
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:40,005
...who felt so insecure, that she lied to him
about finishing community college.

100
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:41,706
Why would you lie about that?

101
00:06:41,883 --> 00:06:44,647
He was going on about this college
and that grad school...

102
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,312
...and I didn't want him to think
I was some kind of stupid loser.

103
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,654
You thought the opposite of "stupid loser"
was "community-college graduate"?

104
00:06:57,532 --> 00:07:00,057
There are a lot of successful people
in this country...

105
00:07:00,235 --> 00:07:02,066
...who are community-college graduates.

106
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:04,467
Yeah, but you are neither.

107
00:07:06,374 --> 00:07:08,672
Right. Okay, look,
this is between you and me.

108
00:07:08,844 --> 00:07:11,938
You cannot tell Leonard any of this.

109
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:16,015
- You're asking me to keep a secret?
- Yeah.

110
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:17,344
Well, I'm sorry.

111
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,750
You would've had to express that desire
before revealing the secret...

112
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:24,881
...so that I could choose whether I wanted
to accept the covenant of secret-keeping.

113
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,121
You can't impose a secret
on an ex post facto basis.

114
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:31,922
What?

115
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,399
Secret-keeping is a complicated endeavor.
One has to be concerned...

116
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,734
...not only about what one says, but about
facial expressions, autonomic reflexes.

117
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:41,473
When I try to deceive...

118
00:07:41,643 --> 00:07:46,342
...I myself have more nervous tics
than a Lyme disease research facility.

119
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,644
It's a joke.

120
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:56,621
It relies on the homonymic relationship
between tick, the bloodsucking arachnid...

121
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,259
...and tic, the involuntary
muscular contraction.

122
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:00,826
[CHUCKLES]

123
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:05,059
I made it up myself.

124
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:12,897
Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied,
I will absolutely die of embarrassment.

125
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:16,066
- Physiologically impossible.
- Oh, Sheldon, please.

126
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:18,235
Look, I'm asking you as a friend.

127
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:21,946
You're saying that friendship
contains within it...

128
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:24,677
...an inherent obligation
to maintain confidences?

129
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:28,289
- Well, yeah.
- Interesting.

130
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:31,257
One more question.
Perhaps I should've led with this:

131
00:08:31,426 --> 00:08:33,485
When did we become friends?

132
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:39,865
I.e., I couldn't become Green Lantern unless
I was chosen by the Guardians of Oa.

133
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:43,027
Given enough startup capital
and an adequate research facility...

134
00:08:43,205 --> 00:08:45,230
...I could be Batman.

135
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:50,940
- You could be Batman?
- Sure.

136
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:52,170
[IN DEEP VOICE]
I'm Batman.

137
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:53,371
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
See?

138
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:56,841
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

139
00:08:57,018 --> 00:08:58,610
- Hi, Penny.
- Hey.

140
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:03,351
If you're not doing anything Friday night,
I thought we could go see a movie.

141
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:06,187
You know, I think I have the dinner shift
on Friday.

142
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:09,057
- Okay. What about Saturday?
- You know, I'm not sure.

143
00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:12,223
The manager hasn't posted the schedule.
How about I let you know?

144
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,424
- Great.
- Okay.

145
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:19,199
So you just let me know when you know.
Okay, so-- Oh, God, I am the bad fish.

146
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:24,036
- What did I do wrong?
- Why are you asking me?

147
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:27,810
I have no information
about your interactions with Penny...

148
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:30,918
...nor do I have any method
of learning such things.

149
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:35,188
LEONARD: What does that mean?
- Nothing.

150
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:38,554
You seem to be implying a back channel
between me and Penny...

151
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:41,423
- ...where, obviously, none exists.
- No, I didn't.

152
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:44,861
I just think you need to be careful
how you phrase things, sir.

153
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:50,735
- What's going on with you?
- Well, I might ask you the same question.

154
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:54,773
Why do you drag me into matters
which have nothing to do with me...

155
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,811
...but exist between you and Penny,
a person to whom I barely speak?

156
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:08,851
What's wrong with your face?

157
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:12,193
There's no reason
to bring my looks into this.

158
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:15,956
- Good day, Leonard.
- What?

159
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:18,429
I said, good day.

160
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:23,101
Good day?

161
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:27,138
Also today we have
a fresh-caught Alaska salmon...

162
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:29,539
...served with a teriyaki glaze
and sticky rice.

163
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:32,544
- Our soup of the day--
- You must release me from my oath.

164
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:38,217
Sheldon, I'm working.

165
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:40,377
Why don't you take a minute to decide?

166
00:10:42,557 --> 00:10:44,024
